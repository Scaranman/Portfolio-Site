<h3>Background</h3>

For this project, I set out to design an interactive UI for an existing museum exhibit. Living in the Philadelphia area, I am lucky to have access to a plethora of museums. However, I set my sights on one particular museum; The Mutter Museum of The College of Physicians of Philadelphia. I wanted to work on an exhibit that was unique, and where else to find unique museum exhibits in Philadelphia other than the Mutter Museum? However, due to the graphic nature of the museum, my choices were rather limited. I chose to create an interactive screen for the Hyrtl Skull Collection. The Hyrtl Skull Collection is a collection of 139 skulls acquired from a Viennese anatomist Joseph Hyrtl (1810-1894) in 1874. Hyrtl's goal with the collection was to show how varied cranial autonomy was in Caucasians in Europe and debunk the claims of phrenologists that cranial feature were an indicator of the level of one's intelligence.

<h3>The Problem</h3>

The Hyrtl Skull Collection, among the Museums many other exhibits, is located in a large glass display case. Due to the sheer amount of skulls, and the glass, the exhibit could be hard for those with low-vision or height restrictions in viewing the skulls freely. Furthermore, visitors could easily be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of skulls and either only look at and read about a few or just briefly glance over the collection. When I visited myself, I only looked at a few skulls before moving on.

<h3>The Solution</h3>

I sought out to design an interactive display that would allow visitors to read about each and every skull without being overwhelmed while also giving them the ability to see the skull in angles not possible from the display case. It would also provide more information about the cranial features of the skull and light up the skull in the display case so as not to take away from the physical exhibit. This would make it easier for visitors with limited sight and height restrictions to look at and read about the skulls, while also encouraging more exhibit engagement from all visitors.

<h3>Wireframes</h3>

I created 3 main screens. One screen where users could browse the skulls in the exhibit, A screen with information about a selected skull (with the real skull in the display case lit up), and a screen where a 3D model of the skull could be viewed and interacted with that made note of certain features of the skulls.

<h3>User Flow</h3>

<h3>Insipration and Style Guide</h3>

I was inspired by retro designed websites, the branding of the museum and the victorian style architecture and interior of the museum.

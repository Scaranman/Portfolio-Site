### Overview

The Vendor Client Gateway is a an optional add-on module for CobbleStone Software's flagship product Contract Insights. 

This portion of the product had long been a point of frustration for both internal stakeholders and clients alike.

As part of the ongoing major UX updates across the system, I led a redesign of the vendor-client gateway in hopes to alleviate client frustrations and potentially boost sales and use of the module.

At this time, the Vendor Client Gateway redesign has not been deployed yet so I do not yet know what the impact will be.

### Who is CobbleStone?

CobbleStone provides contract, vendor, and e-procurement management software. Their software is used by hundreds of organizations spanning the globe. Thousands of legal, sales, and procurement professionals use and trust CobbleStone Software for their contract, sales, and procurement needs. 

### What is Contract Insights?

Contract Insights is an enterprise contract management system that is designed to work with organizations of all sizes and in all industries.

### What is the Vendor Client Gateway?

The Vendor Client Gateway is an purchasable add-on module for Contract Insights that clients use to better communicate with their clients and facilitate e-procurement processes.

### What Was The Problem?

The Vendor Client Gateway had a lot of problems. In fact, probably too many to list. However, to name a few:
- Not responsive
- Depcricated pracitices and visual design
- Overly customizable configurations to the point where clients were making decisions that negatively impacted UX

### My Solution

Redesign the vendor client gateway in a way that takes inspiration from similar and competing portals while cutting down on some of the customization options in order to create a more streamlined experience.

<!-- ### Decisions

Some important decisions I made in the design process included
- Removing the ability for our clients to customize the navigation except for renaming them
  - Previously, our clients were able to completely cutomize the navigation including adding new items and and rearranging them.
- Removing the ability to cutomize the header color
  - Because clients could customize the header color, there were many clients who chose colors that severly negatively impacted the user experience

### Future Plans

The designs shown here show just a snapshop of the all the areas of the vendor client gateway. The designs shown here are for the phase 1 of a 3-phase rollout:

1. Redesign of existing features and functionality
2. Adding addtional functionality (TBD)
3. TBD

Because these designs are more of a redesign of existing features and functionality, some flow can still be a little bit awkward (such as how users interact with solicitations).

Hopefully, once this 1st phase is rolled out, we'll see an uptick in module purchases and usage and as we get more users, we can get a lot more feedback than we currently recieve and use that to further improve it in the next phases.

<!-- ### Conclusion and Results

Guest pass is really interesting because of its dynamic between two types of users: a customer who owns a Elements-based access control security system, and a user who is visiting one of customers locations. As a young designer it was a very enjoyable problem to tackle and I learned a lot about the process of figuring out user flows in such a system. I also learned a lot about animations and how to utilize them to make my designs more responsive.

Guest Pass was successfully put in production in Q4 of 2021. Since it's implementation it has been a become a big success and a major differentiator to competition with users asking for additional features. -->

<h3>The Problem</h3>

In a world with rapidly advancing technology, it's a wonder why community laundry rooms have not gotten the much-needed upgrade. People are forced to wait long periods of time, often hours, waiting for other people to finish doping their laundry or remove their laundry from the machine. There's nothing more infuriating than having to schedule half of your day for laundry because you don't know how crowded it will be.

<h3>The Solution</h3>

Laundy is a part of an idea that I'm sure many people have thought of by now. Create an app that allows members of a community to see the status of the laundry machines in their laundry room in real time. My proposed ideation of this idea, would be integrated with the machines directly, giving live feedback without relying on user input for start and stop. Furthermore, Laundy would allow users to easily make maintenance reports for both machines and facilities with great convenience, giving staff more reports than they might have before

<h3>Evaluation of Lo-fi Prototype</h3>

Evaluation of my lo-fi prototype game me some valuable feedback early on.

<h4>Laundry Tab</h4>

- Due to an unfortunate oversight, users did not understand that the placeholder icon I placed next to the machines in the laundry tab were buttons. In this instance, the problem could have easily been avoided by uses a different placeholder such as a square. This was a mistake I am sure to not make in the future.

- While the design gave the remaining time in running machines, users suggested that unused machines have a timer that reports how long it was finished or how long the door remained closed after the cycle was complete. Maintenance tab

- Users appeared to not understand what the "Not a Machine" checkbox was for.

<h4>Suggestions for Future Features</h4>

- Manual alternative for communities with older machines
- Mobile pay method as an alternative for coin machines

<h3>Hi-fi Prototype</h3>

<h3>Evaluation of Hi-fi Prototype</h3>

<h4>Settings Tab</h4>

- One user got confused between the maintenance and reporting a bug. The user suggested that report a bug should be located in a 4th tab.

<h4>Misc</h4>

- The colleges in the community dropdown were not ordered alphabetically.

<h4>Suggestions for Future Features</h4>

- Add information for machines that says what cycle it is on.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

This project was conducted in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis of 2020 which unfortunately severely limited my access to participants due to time, location, and other obligations brought up by the crisis. Therefore, I unfortunately had very limited data and did not have much feedback to go off of aside from my own judgement. Overall though, I am happy with the way my design turned out. In the future, it might be worth coming back to this project to get more user testing and add more features such as the one's suggested.

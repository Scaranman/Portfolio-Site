Hi, I’m Jacob. I'm a UX Designer from the Philadelphia region. I will be graduating in August from Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) with a B.S. in Human Centered Computing (HCC) and a minor in Japanese.

I got my drive for UX from my family. My father is an architect and my mother went to art school and worked as a graphic designer before pursuing a career in early childhood education. Additionally, my mothers parents were artists and designers. In short, I grew up with a very creative maternal side, and a logical but design-based paternal side.

From a young age I got involved in the use of computers in technology. As a child, I was always on some piece of technology. Whether it be my Gameboy , the Xbox, or the family PC. Needless to say, technology has always been an important part of my life, and I knew I was going to do something with technology.

I have also been learning Japanese since late high school when I went to a Japanese language camp for the summer. From there I knew I was going to continue my studies at RIT and pursued a minor. I credit my original interest in Japanese to my mom. She studied Japanese when she was in college and lived in Kobe for a year. In 2019, I spent my Spring semester in Nagoya, Japan at Nanzan University/南山大学. I spent the first four months of the program in homestay and the last month in a dorm. I spent the following summer on an Internship for Tamago-DB in Tokyo.

I love learning Japanese language and culture and I have extended my interest to other cultures worldwide.

Outside of school and UX, I enjoy video games, hiking, and spending time with my dog, Dexter. I recently started picking up up guitar and teaching myself how to draw.

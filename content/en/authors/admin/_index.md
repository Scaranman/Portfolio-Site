Hi, I’m Jacob. I'm a UX Designer from the Philadelphia region. 

As a UX Designer, I'm passionate about creating intuitive, user-friendly experiences that solve real-world problems. With a B.S. in Human Centered Computing (HCC) and a minor in Japanese from Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), I bring a unique perspective to every project I work on.

My interest in UX design stems from my family background - my father is an architect, and my mother was a graphic designer before transitioning to early childhood education. I've also been fascinated by technology since a young age, spending countless hours playing video games and exploring the capabilities of computers.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I enjoy hiking, going to concerts, and birdwatching. I've also been studying Japanese for several years and spent a semester at Nanzan University in Nagoya, Japan. My experiences both in and outside of the UX world influence my approach to design, and I'm always looking for new ways to innovate and push boundaries.

If you're interested in working together or want to learn more about my design philosophy, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

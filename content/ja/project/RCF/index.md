<h3>問題</h3>

The Rochester Community Foundation (RACF) partners with local businesses and community centers to enrich the lives of people in the region through various community-focused programs and initiatives. The RACF needed a website and platform where recipients of aide programs, such as a SNAP, can obtain discounts codes for participating community centers in region such as the Seneca Park Zoo. They needed a way for visitors to apply for discounts, a method for approving applications, and a way for administrators and participating community centers to manage, view, and maintain various aspects of the site, as well as data analytics.

<h3>解決</h3>

Our plan was to build a site from the ground up where administrators would not need to deal with a complex CMS and everything would be implmented in-site and be very simple for administrators (who may not be so tech savvy) to utilize and manage.

<h4>改正</h4>

A couple months into the project, RACF, notified us that visitors were not buying tickets through their website and were instead only receiving discount codes for individual participating businesses. As such, we had to remove the shopping cart and all of the transaction related designs. Thankfully, the transaction pages were not developed and design was already ahead of where we needed to be so it was not much of an issue.

<h4>付与のポータル</h4>

For the grant portal, we needed something that would allow visitors to easily upload their documents and view their status in the review process. We knew that at any time RACF could stop accepting or start qualifying certain aide programs and at the same time the the government could change how one works, discontinue one, or create a new one. At the same time however, we thought it would be helpful to have uploads categorized to make it easier for applicants and people who were going to review the documents.

As a solution, we create the grant portal where visitors could upload their document according three catagories: local, state, and federal. Visitors could upload multiple documents for each category and a color-coded indicator will inform them of the review status (e.g. pending, approved, declined).

Administrators who are going to review the documents can view the submissions by each visitor along with any information provided in their profile.

<h4> アドミンのポータル</h4>

We need to create a portal for administrators that would have quick links to pages and tools they might need as administrators.

The admin portal gives administrators quick links to sections of the site such as the grant portal, organization settings, and venue/event creation. They can also view recent site activity by any administrator.

<h4>結論</h4>

In the end, our team's project was unfortunately not chosen to be officially deployed for RACF. However, I learned a lot and garnered a lot of valuable experience working within a multi-skilled team. 

Some things I learned
- Sometimes you don't have as much information as you would like and just need to put something out. 
  - If your client or boss does not like something, they will tell you and at least then you have something to go off of.
- Sometimes communication breaks down between group members and certain tasks are not completed by other members when you need them too. If it's something that needs to be shown to a client or boss, sometimes you just need to step up and get something done.
- Assign resposibilities as early as possible and have a structure. 
  - In this project we assigned a lot of the design resposibilities on the fly which made communication difficult at times.
- Create a concrete and senseful asset library and communicate naming schemas early on. 
  - Asset creation was very messy from the start. Most of the assets were not set up properly and naming was inconsistant. All this needs to be talked about, communicated, and developed very early on as a team.

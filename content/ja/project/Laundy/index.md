<h3>問題</h3>

世界中テクノロジーがどんどんこうじょうしていますが洗濯室がまだ同じです。しばしば人がするように長い時間選択待たなければいけないんです。

<!-- In a world with rapidly advancing technology, community laundry rooms still seem to be stuck in the past. People are forced to wait long periods of time, often hours, waiting for other people to finish doping their laundry or remove their laundry from the machine. There's nothing more infuriating than having to schedule half of your day for laundry because you don't know how crowded it will be. -->

<h3>解決</h3>

Laundy allows owners of community laundry rooms such as laundromats and laundry rooms in large buildings such as dorms to give customers or tenants an smarter way of doing laundry. With Laundy, users can:

- tell when a laundry machine is in-use, available, or out of orderz.
- Easily report an issue with the machines or anything else in the facility right from the app.

<h3>ローファイ原型の評価</h3>

Evaluation of my lo-fi prototype gave me some valuable feedback early on.

- Users did not understand that the placeholder icon I placed next to the machines in the laundry tab were buttons.

- Users wished that unused machines had a timer that reports how long it was finished or how long the door remained closed after the cycle was complete.

- Users appeared to not understand what the "Not a Machine" checkbox was for.

<h4>前途の特徴の発案</h4>

- Manual alternative for communities with older machines.
- Mobile pay method as an alternative for coin machines.

<h4>Suggested Revisions</h4>

- Add a timer for unused machines.
- Add a footnote that explains what "Not a machine" means

<h3>ハイファイ原型</h3>

- One user got confused between the maintenance and reporting a bug. The same user suggested that report a bug should be located in a 4th tab.
- The communities in the community dropdown were not ordered alphabetically.

<h4>前途の特徴の発案</h4>

- Add information for machines that says what cycle it is on.

<h4>Suggested Revisions</h4>

- Make the difference between reporting a bug and making a maintenance request more clear.
- Make the communities in the community dropdown in alphabetical order.

<h3>結論</h3>

This project was conducted at the hight of the COVID-19 crisis in 2020 which unfortunately severely limited my access to participants due to time, location, and other obligations brought up by the crisis. Therefore, I unfortunately had very limited data and did not have much feedback to go off of aside from my own judgement. Overall though, I am happy with the way my design turned out. In the future, it might be worth coming back to this project to get more user testing and add more features such as the one's suggested.
